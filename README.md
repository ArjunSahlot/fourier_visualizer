## Features

-   Visualize fourier transform with custom drawings
-   Choose custom colors
-   Save custom drawings
-   Sort cycles in different formats and orders
-   Pause/play
-   Speed controller
-   Playing parameters
-   Clean user-friendly UI

## How to

The UI is really simple to understand but the sorting drop-down maybe a little confusing. You can interact with the drop-down with a right-click or left-click. If you left-click, it will choose the highlighted sorting type or open the drop-down menu. If you right-click, it will change the order (ex: ascending radius, descending radius) which is indicated by an up/down arrow.

## Running on local device

This is one of my pygame projects, [here](https://github.com/ArjunSahlot/ArjunSahlot/blob/main/pygame.md) are the steps to run it.
